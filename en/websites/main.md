# History

**Vanta Interactive initially started out as an idea, back in April 2018**, before actually getting a name and trying to get seriously in game development, in the summer of 2019, when we started under the name '**2A Games**'. Then, we rebranded for a short while to **Evo-Catalyst Softworks** (ECS), and since late 2020, we're **Vanta Interactive** (*No more rebrands or name changes, we promise!*).

# Site history

Unfortunately, the website designs of the 2A Games (v1) and ECS (v2) websites are lost in time, we did manage to find some details about the third version, where we first started using the Vanta Interactive name.

## Version 3

The blog was hosted using Google's Blogger platform, and we were using a free theme from the now-defunct ThemesWear website.

We had a secondary website for one of our projects at the time, GRAV0RTAL, also hosted by Blogger.

The blog uses the free 'Basil' theme from SoraTemplates, loaded the FontAwesome and LinearIcons CSS, Testimonial CSS from Flickity, Animate CSS, jQuery min, WowJS, SlickNav Responsive Mobile Menu, jquery-match-height, Flickity, Waypoints, jquery-counterup, jQuery One Page Nav Plugin and SmoothScroll.

## Version 4

In late 2020, I switched to using the 'Slides' theme from FreeHTML5 for the Vanta Interactive blogger website, pictured below:

As was the trend back then, most of the header buttons used to link to sections of the home page. 'About' would lead to the About Us section. We had pages for /games and /software, but they were blank, and the idea was to update them, but that never happened, for whatever reason. The page contained an ungodly amount of third-party CSS and JS code, such as Bootstrap CSS, some obfuscated JS that even to this day I have no idea what it was for, and at the end we had Waypoint JS, Easing JS, Stellar JS and Magnific Popup JS.

For some reason, at the time I also opened KX Design Lab, it was supposed to be a subdivision of VI that would handle website designs (Figma and HTML, CSS, JS) and app designs in Figma. It was supposed to be another freelance way for the studio to earn some money while teasing our game progress and whatnot. I also linked some of the music I made using FL Studio Mobile from BandCamp, and music used for our games. We also wanted to offer other services such as photography, another way to earn money. None of this went further than a conceptual stage.

## Version 5

In **February 2021**, I started the Vanta-Interactive organization on GitHub, and created the first GitHub Pages-hosted version of the site, using a free bootstrap 4 theme from ColorLib, Mostudio. This, too, used Magnific Popup, FlatIcons, FontAwesome, jQuery min and new scripts: jQuery migrate, popper, bootstrap min, jquery easing, jquery waypoints, jquery stellar, scrollax min, owl carousel, jquery AnimateNumber and Google Maps' js API. No, this didn't cut it either. So I scrapped all that and made a very minimalist site with a white background, and used pictures as links. I had enough of Bootstrap and terrible free templates.

And while in **October 2021** I was working on [my personal website](https://web.archive.org/web/20211001172806/https://alexhowell2a.github.io/), the website was [rotting away](https://web.archive.org/web/20210317220123/https://vanta-interactive.github.io/) with little to no updates. Finally, on December 20, 2022, I deleted the whole website and left it as it is, until this day, with no updates. The intention was to quickly finish up the personal website, polish Obsidian, then use it to quickly bring the VI site up to snuff, but that never happened, as I was busy finishing high school.

## Version 6 (Present)

Funnily, or, surprisingly enough, **as of April 2024, Vanta Interactive is six years old**. It's crazy how time has passed, and how much the studio has evolved - even if we never released any game outside of a [silly little game I pieced together in three days](https://vantainteractive.com/en/games/JumpGame). 

**Sixth time's the charm!** I had experienced burnout in the summer of 2023, even the thought of opening an HTML file related to my project was seriously depressing. And now, it's March/April 2024. I've been working on a proper game that is scheduled to release at the end of April, I need the website up and running. I quickly gather everything, polish Obsidian and I pieced together what you see today, using Jekyll and Liquid. The idea, previously, was to write my own CMS - a bad idea, especially when I knew well Jekyll, tried Hugo and had used Blogger before, which was horrible. All of the Vanta Interactive websites and the AlexTECPlayz website, were rebuilt using Jekyll in under a week.

What am I using today? Simple HTML, Obsidian CSS with some customizations specific to each website's use case, and very little JS. All fonts, css and js are loaded from the repository, because I have principles now. I care about privacy and security. I don't want to collect cookies, or to bombard the users with cookie pop-ups. How the times have changed.

**What are the plans for the future?** More polish, and maybe some additions to the home page, as more projects get teased or released.
